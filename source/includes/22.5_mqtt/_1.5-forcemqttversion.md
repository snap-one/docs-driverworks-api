## ForceMqttVersion

The MQTT version that is currently used by default is 3.11.   If you need to use a different version for any reason, you will need to call `ForceMqttVersion(version)` to set the MQTT version you wish to connect with.

###### Available from 4.0.0


### Signature

`ForceMqttVersion(version)`


| Parameters | Description                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| version    | An integer that indicates the version of MQTT that should be used when establishing a connection. _See the versions table below for valid values._ |


### Returns

If an invalid version integer is provided or the connection has already started, a string is returned indicating that an error occurred.  On success, 0 is returned.  On error, two values are returned.  The first value is a number indicating the error, the second is a string that describes the error.

### Allowed Versions

| Integer to use | Version applied   |
| -------------- | ----------------- |
| 3              | MQTT version 3    |
| 311            | MQTT version 3.11 |
| 5              | MQTT version 5    |

### Notes

This call must be made before the call to connect to the broker.   It is not allowed by the MQTT standard to change the version once the connection to the broker is established.
