## Quality of Service Values

Several of the MQTT API calls allow you to set a Quality of Service (QoS) value. This value controls the guarantees related to a published message, or messages from a subscription.


| QoS Level | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0         | **At most once.** The client publishes the message, and there is no acknowledgement by the broker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 1         | **At least once.** This method guarantees that the message will be transferred successfully to the broker. The broker sends an acknowledgement back to the sender, but in the event that that the acknowledgement is lost the sender won't realize the message has got through, so will send the message again. The client will re-send until it gets the broker's acknowledgement. This means that sending is guaranteed, although the message may reach the broker more than once. |
| 2         | **Exactly once.** This is the highest level of service, in which there is a sequence of four messages between the sender and the receiver, a kind of handshake to confirm that the main message has been sent and that the acknowledgement has been received. When the handshake has been completed, both sender and receiver are sure that the message was sent exactly once.                                                                                                       |
