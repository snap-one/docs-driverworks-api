## OnDriverLateInit

Function  that serves as a callback into a project after the project is loaded. If any initialization has to occur after the project is loaded, it must occur in OndriverLateInit. See the [safe usage table][1] for a list of APIs that can be invoked before OnDriverLateInit is executed. For further information, please see the [Driver Initialization and Destruction][2] best practices documentation.


###### Available from 2.5.0


### Signature

`OnDriverLateInit(strDIT)Â `


| Parameter | Description                                                                                            |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| str       | This optional parameter indicates the scenario in which the driver is initializing. Scenarios include: |
|           | `DIT_ADDING`: Called as a result of the driver being added to a project.                               |
|           | `DIT_STARTUP`: Called as a result of Director starting or a new project being loaded.                  |
|           | `DIT_UPDATING`: Called as a result of the driver being updated.                                        |

The DIT parameters are available in O.S. 3.2.0 and later.


### Example

```lua
function OnDriverLateInit(driverInitType)

    if (driverInitType == "DIT_ADDING") then
        -- Initialization needed only when the driver is added
        -- to a project
    elseif (driverInitType == "DIT_STARTUP") then
        -- Initialization needed only during initial startup
    elseif (driverInitType == "DIT_UPDATING") then
        -- Initialization needed only after a driver update
    end

-- Release things this driver had allocated...
function OnDriverDestroyed()
end
