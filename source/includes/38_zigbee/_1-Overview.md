## Overview

DriverWorks and Zigbee Functionality 

DriverWorks support for Zigbee functionality was originally delivered in release 1.6.1. This section has been included to provide information to Control 4 partners already using the Zigbee SDK. This information will support the development of DriverWorks Zigbee functionality so that partners using the Zigbee SDK can integrate into the Control 4 system.

Functionality provided in support of Zigbee functionality currently includes:

- Allowing DriverWorks driver developers to send data to and receive data from ZigBee devices using either EmberNet or ZigBee Pro

- Allow ZigBee SDK developers the ability to update their ZigBee devices using DriverWorks. 

- Allow ZigBee SDK developers the ability to utilize the Control4 identification mechanism, but define their own ID strings.
