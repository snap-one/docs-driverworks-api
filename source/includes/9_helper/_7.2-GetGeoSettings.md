## GetGeoSettings
Lua function that enables a Lua driver to retrieve the geo location that was retrieved from webservices. For more information, please see [Director and Geo Location Services][1].


###### Available from 3.2.0


### Signature
`C4:GetGeoSettings()`


### Parameters
None


### Returns
The method returns multiple values consisting of string, string:

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
|str| Country code|
|str| Country name|


### Usage Notes
A driver can retrieve the geo location as follows:

`countryCode, countryName = C4:GetGeoSettings()`

A driver can retrieve the project location as follows:

`countryCode = C4:GetProjectProperty("countrycode")`

`countryName = C4:GetProjectProperty("countryname")`


If a driver falls back to using the project location, it is imperative (due to regulations) that it retry the call to `C4:GetGeoSettings()` on some regular interval. It is recommended that the driver use the same interval as Director, which is 1 hour (by default). The driver can set a timer to retry the call to `C4:GetGeoSettings()`.
